Feature: Payflow Gateway Express payments should display products with localized data
  In order to be able to see localized products in the payment
  As a buyer
  I want to be able to create pay and see product name and description in the payment,
  in the localization that used in current moment

  Scenario: Feature Background

    And There are products in the system available for order
    And I create PayPal PaymentsPro integration with following settings:

    And I create payment rule with "ExpressPayPal" payment method

  Scenario: Successful first order payment with  PayPal PayFlow Gateway
    Given I login as AmandaRCole@example.org the "Buyer" at "first_session" session
    And I am on the homepage
    When I type "SKU123" in "search"
    And click "Search Button"
    Then I should not see "ZU product shortdesc" for "SKU123" product
    When click "View Details" for "SKU123" product
    Then I should not see "ZU product desc"
    And I click "Localization Switcher"
    And I select "Zulu" localization
    When I type "SKU123" in "search"
    And click "Search Button"
