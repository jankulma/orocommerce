# OroValidationBundle

OroValidationBundle provides a set of [custom validators and constraints](https://github.com/oroinc/orocommerce/tree/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ValidationBundle/Validator/Constraints) that may be used in other bundles to complement the standard set of [Symfony validators](https://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/constraints.html) to ensure the object's data is correct.
