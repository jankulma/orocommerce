                    tooltip: This shipping integration does not perform dimension-based package distribution optimizations ("box packing optimization") prior to requesting shipping estimates from FedEx. This may lead to over-inflated FedEx shipping estimates if the order contains multiple bulky items. You may turn this option on to ignore package dimensions and use only weight-based FedEx shipping estimates.
