## Content Blocks

An administrator can modify a predefined marketing content in the frontend by editing the defined content blocks.

The `ContentBlock` entity fields consist of:

- `alias`, a unique identifier that can be used in the layout to [render block](#render-content-block-in-the-layout);
- `scopes`, a collection of scopes that defines the conditions for the content block to be displayed. For more information, refer to the
[ScopeBundle](https://github.com/orocrm/platform/blob/master/src/Oro/Bundle/ScopeBundle/README.md) documentation.;
- `titles`, a localized block title that can be rendered along with the scope;
- `contentVariants`, a collection of the `TextContentVariant` entities. Each content variant has a scope that defines when it should be rendered. Only one content variant with the most suitable scope is rendered at a time. 
If there is no suitable content variant, the default one is rendered instead.
 
### Manage Content Blocks

An administrator can edit the defined content blocks in the **Marketing > Content Blocks** menu.

### Create a Content Block 

A developer can create content blocks with a collection of predefined content variants using data migrations:

```php
use Doctrine\Common\DataFixtures\AbstractFixture;
use Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ObjectManager;

use Oro\Bundle\CMSBundle\Entity\ContentBlock;
use Oro\Bundle\CMSBundle\Entity\TextContentVariant;
use Oro\Bundle\LocaleBundle\Entity\LocalizedFallbackValue;

class LoadHomePageSlider extends AbstractFixture
{
    /**
     * @param ObjectManager $manager
     */
    public function load(ObjectManager $manager)
    {
        $slider = new ContentBlock();
        $slider->setAlias('marketing-block');

        $title = new LocalizedFallbackValue();
        $title->setString('Block title');
        $slider->addTitle($title);

        $variant = new TextContentVariant();
        $variant->setDefault(true);
        $variant->setContent('<p>Block content</p>');
        $slider->addContentVariant($variant);

        $manager->persist($slider);
        $manager->flush($slider);
    }
}
```

### Render a Content Block in the Layout

Content blocks can be rendered by unique `aliases` using the `content_block` block type:
 
```yaml
layout:
    actions:
        - @add:
            id: marketing_block # unique layout block id
            parentId: page_content
            blockType: content_block
            options:
                alias: marketing-block # unique content block id
```
**Note**

An administrator can rename or delete defined content blocks. So if there is no content block with the defined alias that may be caused by a typo in a block name or non-existence of the block itself, nothing will be rendered, and no errors will be displayed. A `notice` message will be written to log.

If you have rendered a content block to the layout, but nothing is displayed, check the following:

 - the content block should be enabled;
 - the content block should have at least one suitable scope or should not have any scope at all that means the block is rendered without any restriction.
