# General Information

The configuration data of 'Shipping Origin' is used in the UPS bundle representing a shipper that is responsible for shipping from a particular address. Therefore, it should be configured in the system configuration menu. 

Navigate to **System > Configuration > Commerce > Shipping > Shipping Origin** to reach the page.

The UPS bundle provides a new integration type with specific parameters (such as Base URL, Shipping Service, etc.) and can be created on the *Integrations* page in the system configuration:

**System > Integrations > Manage Integrations**

It is possible to create several different integrations with the 'UPS' type.
Once the integration is saved, a new shipping method becomes available in the system with the shipping types selected as shipping services.
The newly created shipping method with types are available on the *Shipping Rules* page in the system configuration: 

**System > Shipping Rules**

A new UPS method is displayed in the 'Shipping Method' step during the checkout. The prices are displayed as well if the corresponding rule is set.
