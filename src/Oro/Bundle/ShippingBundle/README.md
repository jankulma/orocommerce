# OroShippingBundle

OroShippingBundle introduces the shipping methods integration framework for the OroCommerce applications.

The bundle enables developers to add new Shipping Methods by implementing shipping method interfaces. It also provides UI for management console users to enable Shipping Methods and configure their visibility in storefront orders via Shipping Rules.
