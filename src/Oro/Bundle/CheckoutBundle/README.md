# OroCheckoutBundle

OroCheckoutBundle enables the checkout workflows in the OroCommerce storefront to gather necessary information from the customer during the order creation process. For the management console administrators, the bundle provides the ability to switch between the single page and multi-step page checkout workflows using the system workflow management UI.
