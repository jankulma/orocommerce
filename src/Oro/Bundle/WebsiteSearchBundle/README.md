# OroWebsiteSearchBundle

OroWebsiteSearchBundle extends [OroSearchBundle](https://doc.oroinc.com/bundles/platform/SearchBundle/) capabilities to provide search functionality for the OroCommerce storefront, and creates an additional search index for this purpose based on the [scopes](https://doc.oroinc.com/bundles/platform/ScopeBundle/).

It also enables developers to configure this search index in the YAML configuration files in the individual bundles.

For more information, see online documentation for [WebsiteSearchBundle](https://doc.oroinc.com/bundles/platform/WebsiteSearchBundle/).
