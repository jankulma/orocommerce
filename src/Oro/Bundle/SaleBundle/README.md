# OroSaleBundle

OroSaleBundle introduces quote management features in the OroCommerce application.

The bundle enables sales representatives to create a quote for customer users and manage it according to the workflow that is configured by the administrator in the management console. It also provides customer users the ability to accept the quote and create an order based on it, or decline quotes in their storefront _My account_ menu.
